A mature pack for immature people. The idea for this modpack came when a group of our staff members thought it would be funny to find the weirdest, most immature mods we could find and make a Modpack and Server. Today, Maturecraft lives on as a modpack with some silly mods I have found over the years. If you have any suggestions, be sure to let us know on our discord. 

This repository is a collection of file modifications specifically created for the custom modpack. These modifications include changes to various configuration files such as .toml, .cfg, .txt, .json, and others. These files have been modified to ensure that the modpack functions correctly and provides the desired gameplay experience.

This modpack is maintained by Carhenia for [Nebula Network](https://nebulanetwork.net)
